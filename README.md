To use this simply make a .txt file with your input, place it in the folder for the day you wish to run.

NOTE: It's very importand that the data in the .txt file is exactly the way it was presented on the puzzle input page, extra newlines or spaces can mess things upp.

Run main,py from the command line with the day number and name of .txt file as arguments. Example:
> python3 main.py 2 sample

NOTE: Do not include .txt in the filename
